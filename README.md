## 🎯 Objectives

Based on my Python Password generator, the purpose of this project was to create standalone functional, browser-based Chrome Extension. 
This extension allows users to generate a secure, randomized password based on user input.

Key goals of the project:

- Create a lightweight and intuitive browser extension
- Implement customizable password options (length, character types, etc.)
- Rebuild the password generation logic in JavaScript (from Python)
- Learn and apply Chrome Extension development fundamentals
- Practice front-end UI design using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
- Showcase applied skills in real-world browser-based development
